# BigDataTKinterVisualizations
A simple GUI applications that analyzes and visualizes some Stats Canada data sets. Implemented using TKinter, Pandas, and GeoPandas.

This is a first step towards the creation of a GUI based visualization tool that can be used to analyze and answer questions from a variety of data sets. Feel free to edit the code, I usually approve changes within a day or two.


Special thanks to Stats Canada (https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/start) for the data sets, and ARCGIS (https://www.arcgis.com/index.html) for the Canadian shape files.
