# BigDataTKinterVisualizations
A simple GUI applications that analyzes and visualizes some Stats Canada data sets. Implemented using TKinter, Pandas, and GeoPandas.

This is a first step towards the creation of a GUI based visualization tool that can be used to analyze and answer questions from a variety of data sets. Feel free to edit the code, I usually approve changes within a day or two.
